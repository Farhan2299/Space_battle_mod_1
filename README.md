# Space_battle_mod_1
Thinking about making different stages in the battle where the
ending is you either lose and earth gets destroyed, or you win
and the alien fleet is destoryed

-maybe add an animation where the earth is destroyed in keyframes?

-maybe also add an animation where all alien ships get individually
destroyed like popcorn in whichever stage you are in
